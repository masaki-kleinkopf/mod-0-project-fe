## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  -One point that was important from the Growth Mindset article is striving to tackle problems that are difficult but not too difficult. I have found this to be important, because often when I am trying to learn, I tackle tasks that are much too difficult for me at the stage I am at, and have found much more growth when intentionally challenging myself with things tasks that are hard but not discouragingly difficult.
  -Another point I resonate with is seeking out challenge. I am trying to reprogram myself to understand that feeling challenged and frustrated can actually be very good for me. I try to find the zone of productive struggle, where I am challenged but still able to progress after working at the problem.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  -I think I had a Growth Mindset in my approach to music, which was what I did for the past many years. When learning new techniques, or working on my musicianship, I would try to challenge myself and learn new music and new mediums within music. It is really rewarding to approach art that way, as there an infinite amount of things to learn in music.
  -I don't think I demonstrate a Growth Mindset sometimes in my career or professional life. I know that I am not as comfortable with this side, so I think that fear and uncomfort stop me from going out and making mistakes when trying to do things like network, find jobs and advocate for myself.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  -That felt annoying at first, but of course it made me learn and remember how to do these things for myself. It didn't feel too uncomfortable and I find I am much more engaged when pushed in this way.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  -A conditional statement is basically a statement saying do this thing or another thing based on some kind of condition. In my life that could be "If it is Monday, do the laundry. Otherwise, do not do the laundry." An example of an app might be on Twitter. If a profile is set to private, restrict access to tweets to only followers. I'm sure that would be incredibly complicated in practice however.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  -The program first checks the first conditional, which will follow `if`. If that condition is not met, we can write `else if` to check another condition that would return a different result. We can do more `else if` for specific conditions, or we can write `else` for anything that falls outside those conditions, and that will return something else.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  -A developer can use the || and && operators to check for two conditions. The || will check if 1 of 2 conditions are met, while the && checks if both are met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  -I think I understand the basics, but again am confused on how these might be used in bigger complex ways, and how to conceptualize these on a larger scale.
