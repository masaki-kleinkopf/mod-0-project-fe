#Array Methods
- pop(): This method takes the last element in the list (the array), returns it, and then deletes the element from the original array, so that when you use the array again that element will not be present, and the length will be one shorter. So if you had an array of 5 elements with the last element 'broccoli', use pop to remove the 'brocoli' which it will return, and it will reduce the array to 4 elements.

- push(): This method adds to the end array, (one or more elements) and then returns the length of the array accounting for what was just added. So if you use the push method to add one element named 'cars' to an array of 4 elements, it would add 'cars' to the end of the array, and return the value 5 for the length of the new array.

- shift(): This method removes the first element in the array, and then returns this element that was just removed. For example, if you have an array with first element 'celery' in an array of 5 elements, it will remove 'celery', return it, and it reduces the array to a length of 4.

- unshift(): This method adds to the beginning of the array (can add one or more elements) and then returns the length of this new array. For example if you have an array with 2 elements, use unshift to add two elements at the beginning of the array, and then then return the length 4 for the new array.
