## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

- It felt more challenging, and took a little bit longer, but in general was more interesting and fun.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- Maybe a school grading app like Canvas. An array could hold each student in the class, or each instructor if there were multiple. Or hold each assignment with grade.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- An array method is a built-in method, which is basically a function, that can applied to Arrays. So we can call these methods without needing to build the functions ourselves. For example a we can use a push method, to add an element to the end of our array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- The purpose of a loop is to tell our code to go through the code a certain amount of times. We could use a simple loop, on something that contains only one element, to repeat a simple message a certain amountof time. If we have an array (multiple elements) and want our code to through each element in the loop, we can set the number of loops to equal the amount of elements in the array, and return different values depending on what element is being used in each iteration.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- Basically, we do something, and each time it is done a counter goes up. We set a number above the counter. When it reaches that number we stop doing it.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- Similar to other sections, I think I understand the basics of Arrays and loops, but I'm looking forward to seeing how these are used in more complex ways, and especially in ways that don't simply print a message. I have a basic understanding of how conditionals might work with Arrays and loops, but don't feel super comfortable with that concept as well.
