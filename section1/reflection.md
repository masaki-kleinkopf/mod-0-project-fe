## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between

When I'm in a good headspace and environment I think I am somewhere in between. However, in the past I have waited too long to ask questions for fear of embarrassment.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  1. String. This is usually containing text but can contain numbers or anything else as well. Must use quotes to surround.
  2. Numbers. These are numbers, don't need to use quotes. Can handle all numbers such as decimals or negatives, not just positive integers.
  3. Boolean. This data type is binary, either true or false, not other option.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You use the characters '//' to indicate comments in a JavaScript file. The purpose is for clarity, to explain or illuminate a piece of code to make it clearer for others or for yourself when you come back to it.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

I would say a variable is something that holds information, that you can re-use. I would explain it to a 5 year old by saying: We are using a word, and from now on this word will actually mean this number or anything else we want it to. I would use a really simple example like, var dog = spot, and tell them every time you see the word dog, we are referring to spot.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I'm not really sure. Maybe a site like Instagram. Variables might be used for user information like age, location and amount of followers.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Combining together data, even different types of data, by adding them together and then outputting something in one data type.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Probably a site like Facebook. When seeing something like "Bruce commented on this post" I imagine they would have to concatenate this individual names which are probably stored in variables, with "commented on this post" which is used over and over again.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I think I am understanding the basics, but I am not really grasping how these would be used in an app. The overall purpose and importance of variables when trying to create something bigger I am pretty confused on, how exactly do these variables interact to create larger bits of code?
